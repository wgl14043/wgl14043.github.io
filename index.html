 Born in Brooklyn and raised in Baltimore, Carmelo Anthony knew success at an early age. By the time he was 18 he was already the number one player in his recruiting class and the next year led his college team, Syracuse, to the NCAA Championship. He was then given the tournament's Most Outstanding Player award. Shortly after this success he decided that he would enter into the NBA draft.

He was originally cut from his highschool team and had to work hard to get better and catch the coaches eye. By his junior year of highschool he had already commit to Syracuse.
